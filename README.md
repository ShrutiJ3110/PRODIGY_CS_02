# Image Encryption and Decryption Tool

## Project Description

This Python-based tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques. The program supports two primary methods: **channel swapping** and **mathematical operations**. With its intuitive process, users can secure their images and restore them with ease. The tool is designed for simplicity, ensuring that users can handle image encryption and decryption efficiently.

## Features

- **Encryption Methods**:
  - **Channel Swap**: Swaps the red and blue channels of an image for encryption.
  - **Mathematical Operations**: Uses addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division with a key to alter pixel values.
- **Decryption Support**:
  - Reverses the encryption process using the same method and key.
- **Batch Processing**:
  - Automatically processes all images in a specified folder.
- **Customizable**:
  - Users can choose their preferred encryption method, mathematical operation, and key.
