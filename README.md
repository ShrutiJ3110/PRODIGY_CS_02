# Image Encryption and Decryption Tool

This is a Python-based tool developed as part of my Cyber Security internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using different cryptographic methods.

## Features
- **Channel Swap Method**: Swaps the red and blue channels of an image for encryption.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Performs encryption/decryption on pixel values using basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with a user-defined key.
- **Supports batch processing** for multiple images (PNG, JPG, JPEG).
- Provides flexibility for encrypting and decrypting images in a folder.

## Installation
To use this tool, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PRODIGY_CS_02.git
